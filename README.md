# Ableton-Landing-Page-Clone

My clone : https://nichoerlangga.github.io/Ableton-Landing-Page-Clone/

The actual website : https://www.ableton.com/en/about/

This is my first landing page that i made. I found that cloning a website is a really good way to practice my layouting ability and recalling some things i forgot without taking a long time in design process. There are some features that need to be added with javascript (currently still in the process of learning javscript).

## Features that need to be added soon:
* Dropdown menu
* Responsive navbar
*	Disappearing navbar when scrolling
